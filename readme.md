# Exploring the Link Between Sleep Disorders and Health Indicators


## Project Overview

 This notebook uses Python to analyse a MIMIC-IV health data (DREAMT) in order to uncover insights into factors affecting sleep disorders.
 I analysed participants’ information from the DREAMT dataset in order to uncover relationships between sleep disorders like sleep apnea, snoring, difficulty breathing, headaches, Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), snorting and participant characteristics like age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), Arousal Index, Mean Oxygen Saturation (Mean_SaO2), medical history, Obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) and Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI).

 All insights uncovered are outlined in the notebook.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with healthcare datasets and perform data analytics.


## Objectives

The outcome will be a comprehensive data analytics report with visualizations, insights, and conclusion.


## Dataset

The data being used for this analysis comes from DREAMT: Dataset for Real-time sleep stage EstimAtion using Multisensor wearable Technology 1.0.1. DREAMT is part of the MIMIC-IV datasets hosted by PhysioNet.

This is a curated dataset collected from 100 patients using Empatica E4. The original purpose of the study was to match high resolution physiological signals to sleep stage information and sleep apnea events extracted from Polysomnography.

However, in the current project, I am only using the participants’ information section to create an analysis on the factors affecting the likelihood of of the various sleep disorders as potrayed by information provided on participants who were recruited for the DREAMT study.
